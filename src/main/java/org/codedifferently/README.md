## Weekend Project Assignment

### How it works:

- The first thing it does is ask the user for their first name
- Secondly, the system asks the user for their budget
- After that the user is prompted to enter their budget amount
- Lastly they need to input their coupon code

### Methods/Steps used:

- Random Number Generation – Using java.util.Random to create random numbers for visit IDs, item prices, and tax rates.

- User Input – Using java.util.Scanner to let the user enter their budget.

- Math Utility Methods – Using Math.min() and Math.max() to make sure totals stay in the budget.

- Conditional Statements – Using if / else to check if the total goes over the budget or if there’s money left.

- Math Calculations – Adding item prices, calculating subtotal, tax, and the final total.

- String Formatting – Making money values look neat with two decimal places.
